            <span id= "highlighted-text">Democracy Learning is a Top Priority for Postsecondary 
            Education.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span id= "highlighted-text"> With democracy facing profound challenges at home and abroad, 
            higher education’s civic mission—affirmed since the founding of the 
            Republic--has become more important than ever before. Today, with 
            the majority of Americans seeking postsecondary education, higher 
            education can become an essential training ground for civic leadership and 
            community engagement. Through our efforts, each new generation can prepare 
            for its role in supporting a common and public good.</span>
           <br><br>
            Hundreds of postsecondary institutions already have taken concerted action 
            to renew their civic missions. Through the creation of curricula engaged with 
            real world problems, powerful civic experiences and research, and long-term 
            community partnerships, pacesetting institutions across all sectors of higher 
            education now are contributing to the development of more just and inclusive 
            societies, at home and abroad.
            <br><br>
            These efforts are a strong beginning, but much more is needed to make democracy 
            learning expected, rather than possible, for postsecondary students. Today, higher
            education is dotted with pockets of great democracy learning and practice. But to 
            fulfill higher education’s civic mission, we need to make civic inquiry and 
            democracy engagement part of each student’s educational pathway.
            <br><br>
            As the 1947 Truman Commission urged after the horrors of World War II, higher 
            education’s principal purposes are to bring “to all the people of the Nation, 
            a fuller realization of democracy in every sphere of life” and the 
            “application of creative imagination and trained intelligence to the solution 
            of social problems....”
            <br><br>
            Today our social problems encompass equity, the environment, racial healing and 
            justice, social trust, food and housing security, economic opportunity, and a 
            living wage for all who work. For many students, these problems are both daily 
            realities and daunting barriers to college enrollment and persistence.
            <br><br>
            Students want to help create solutions that transform lives. We owe all students 
            a quality education that empowers them to learn and act, alongside diverse partners, 
            to build a better future. We owe them, as well, a strong foundation in civil 
            discourse–the capacity and commitment to engage respectfully and productively with 
            views and experiences different from their own.
            <br><br>
            Equally important, we must rally to build public recognition that, just as civic 
            learning is a core purpose for postsecondary education, it also builds essential 
            workforce skills. Teamwork, communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, 
            and engagement across differences are the real-world skills that build both better 
            democracies and creative economies. Investing in democracy learning expands economic 
            opportunity as well.
            <br><br>
            <span id="highlighted-text">
            It is time to make high quality, equity-committed civic learning expected and 
            experienced across postsecondary education.
